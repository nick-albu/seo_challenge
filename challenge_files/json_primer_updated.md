# What is JSON?
Think back to the web services lesson from two chapters ago. Remember the part which
discussed the possible data formats that a RESTful service supports? It listed things like plain text and binary, but also `JSON`. This lesson covers `JSON` (pronounced Jay-son), a very common and elegant way of formatting data.


Even though it sounds like it, `JSON` was not created and named by someone called Jason. Instead, `JSON` is short for `JavaScript Object Notation`. The acronym may specify `JavaScript`, but `JSON` is widely adopted and is used far beyond the world of `JavaScript`. 

## Why use JSON?
One of the reasons it is so widely adopted is because of its simplicity.
`JSON` assigns roles and meaning to a few different symbols to create a standalone & comprehensive data format.

We'll cover these symbols and the formatting rules in this lesson.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> One of JSON's biggest pros is that it plays exceptionally well with the
  Object Oriented Paradigm. Before JSON web-services used XLM (Extensible Markup Language) which does this
  much less gracefully, is less expressive and is harder to read.
</div>

## JSON Example
Below you can see a sample of some `JSON`. Take a look but don't be overwhelmed. We'll pick it apart bit by bit.

```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Leanne Graham",
    "username": "Bret",
    "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
    "address": {
      "street": "Kulas Light",
      "suite": "Apt. 556",
      "city": "Gwenborough",
      "zipcode": "92998-3874",
      "geo": {
        "lat": "-37.3159",
        "lng": "81.1496"
      }
    },
    "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
    "website": "hildegard.org",
    "company": {
      "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
      "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
      "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
    }
  }
```

`JSON` indicates the beginning and end of data with curly brackets. You can see this in the example above.

Make sure you don't ignore these tags. It can cause some confusing errors.

## How do you write a JSON file?

Starting with the basics, you can see that the actual data is stored in `key-value pairs`.
Like the username line in the example above, the `key` is a variable name and must be surrounded
with quotation marks. The `key` is then followed with a colon which tells
JSON **parsers** that the data assigned to that key begin here.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> A parser is a service which can pull apart and translate certain data
  formats like JSON.
</div>

After the colon the data begins. Depending on the data type, you may have to surround
it with quotation marks. The general rule is if the datatype is anything other than a
number, a boolean or null, it needs quotes.

## What does a key-value pair look like?

Putting this together, the key-value format is:

`"{insert_key}": {insert_number}`

OR

`"{insert_key}": "{insert_String}"`

OR

`"{insert_key}": {true/false}`

OR

`"{insert_key}": null`

## How do you add multiple key-value pairs to a JSON file?

You just learnt how to express a single piece of data in `JSON`, but we want to be
able to save more than just one field in a file. In order to do this, `JSON` employs commas
to separate fields. Here's what it looks like:

"{insert_key}": {insert_number},
"{insert_key}": "{insert_String}",
"{insert_key}": {true/false}

Notice how the final `key-value pair` does not have a comma.

## How do you add Arrays in a JSON file?
As you know, `Arrays` are some of the most intensely used coding data structure out there. They are great
tools and so `JSON` needs a way to express them as well. `Arrays` in `JSON` are begin and end with square brackets and
each piece of data in the array is separated by a comma.

### Array in JSON example

```json
[
1573857,
2573852,
3573959
]
```

## What about an Array with String values?
Keep in mind that the same quotation datatype rules laid out for `key-value pairs` still hold
true for data embedded in an `Array`. An array with `String` values would look like this:

### Array with String values example

```json
[
"this is part of the example",
"this is another part of the example",
"this is another another part of the example"
]
```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> Arrays can contain any type of data. You can mix and match data types within Arrays
  (even though this is not recommended. You'll see why later.) and can even embed an array within an array.
</div>

## How do you add a JSON Array to a key-value pair?
You now know what a `JSON array` looks like, but how do they fit it into the overall `key-value` structure?
To do this, it may be easier to imagine that `Arrays` are just another datatype like `String` and `booleans`. Following this reasoning, `Strings` or `numbers` in JSON `key-value pairs` only need to be replaced by an `Array`. Take a look:

### Array in key-value pair example
```json
{
"thisIsAKey": null,
"thisIsAlsoAKey": [
  "this",
  "is",
  "an",
  "array",
  "of",
  "strings"
]
}
```
## Objects in JSON
This lesson previously mentioned that `JSON` plays very well with the `Object Oriented Paradigm`, but so far
we haven't mentioned or seen the `JSON` equivalent of an `object`. Let's fix that and really bring `JSON` to life.

## Building a JSON Object
To indicate the start of an `object` and end of an object `JSON` uses **{** and **}** respectively.
This is similar to an `array` except that a JSON `object` is much more flexible. Instead of just storing
data points a JSON `object` can store `key-value pairs`. This means that I can embed objects within objects and
arrays within objects.

### JSON Objects with embedded array

```json
{
"name": "Ben",
"firstObject": {
      "embeddedKey": true,
      "embeddedArray": [
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4
      ],
      "embeddedObject": {
            "embeddedKeyWithinAnObjectWithinAnObject": 4759385,
            "thatLastKeyWasLong": "very long"
      }
}
}
```

The above `JSON` begins with a simple `key-value` pair with key "name" and value "Ben". The next `key-value` pair
is called firstObject and it stores an `object` with 3 fields:

1. a `key-value` pair called embeddedKey with value true  
2. an `array` named embeddedArray which stores the values 1,2,3 and 4, 
3. and another `object` named embeddedObject. embeddedObject in turn contains 2 primitive `key-value` pairs.

## Sending single values in JSON

To understand how to send single values in `JSON`, we need to revisit the opening ({) and closing (})
tags for `JSON` data. To kickstart this `JSON` explanation it was easier to call these
curly brackets opening and closing tags. However, they are not really tags. Instead, they
indicate the start of an `object`. So almost anything you send in `JSON` is technically an `object`.

There are 2 exceptions to this rule:

1. When sending a primitive variable, you are not required to include these two brackets.
But if you decide to omit them, you won't be able to include a key. You can only enter a value. This isn't really `JSON` anymore, but it works.

2. When sending a single array you can also leave out the two curly brackets. They are
effectively replaced by square brackets to indicate the beginning of the array, but just like sending a primitive datatype you can no longer include a `key`. 

## Example of when not to use curly brackets:
(enjoy the captivating lorem ipsum)

```json
[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
    "body": "quia et suscipit"
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "qui est esse",
    "body": "est rerum temporen debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 3,
    "title": "ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit aut",
    "body": "et iusto sed quo iure voluptatem occaecati omnis eligendi"
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 4,
    "title": "eum et est occaecati",
    "body": "ullam et saepe reiciendis voluptatem luptatem rerum illo velit"
  }
]
```

The example above not only illustrates how to express a `single array` in `JSON` but also how to
store `objects` within `arrays`.
